# SCorrelatorUtilities 

This is a namespace which collects various useful types, methods, etc. used throughout the sPHENIX Cold QCD Energy-Energy Correlator analysis.
As this is used throughout the entire analysis chain, this library should be built first. As always, build with:

```
cd src
./sphx-build
```
